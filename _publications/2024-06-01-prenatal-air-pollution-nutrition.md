excerpt: "This paper examines the impact of prenatal exposure to air pollution on early childhood cognitive development and the potential mitigating role of nutritional interventions in China. Using variation in fetal exposure to PM2.5, we show that higher in-utero pollution levels reduce cognitive outcomes in early childhood. A randomized micronutrient supplementation program partially offsets these adverse effects, suggesting that improved nutrition can buffer some of the developmental damage caused by environmental shocks during gestation. These findings underscore the importance of complementary health and nutrition policies in alleviating the long-term consequences of environmental risk in developing countries."
