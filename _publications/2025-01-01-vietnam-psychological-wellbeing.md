excerpt: "This paper studies the long-run effects of early-life war exposure on late-life human capital in Vietnam. We combine village-level bombing intensity from U.S. military records with geocoded survey data from the 2018 and 2021 waves of the Longitudinal Study of Aging and Health in Vietnam (LSAHV), linking individuals to local conflict exposure nearly five decades earlier. To address endogeneity, we exploit distance to the 17th parallel as an instrument for bombing intensity."
