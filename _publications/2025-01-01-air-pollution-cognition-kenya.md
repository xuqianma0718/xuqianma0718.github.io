**Abstract:**  
This paper examines the short-run impact of contemporaneous exposure to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) on cognitive performance in midlife adults in Kenya. Using high-frequency personal exposure data collected via Atmotube monitors and linked to detailed cognitive assessments from the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), we estimate the causal effects of pollution exposure on multiple cognitive domains. We document that higher real-time PM₂.₅ exposure significantly reduces cognitive performance, with effects concentrated in measures of general cognition. These findings provide new evidence on the immediate cognitive costs of air pollution in low- and middle-income settings and underscore the broader human capital implications of environmental health risks.
