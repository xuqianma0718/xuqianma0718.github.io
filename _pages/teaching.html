## Teaching Philosophy

I began to think differently about teaching when I realized that understanding a method is not the same as knowing how to use it. In health economics, students can often reproduce calculations or follow a model step-by-step, yet feel uncertain when assumptions shift or when a policy problem does not fit neatly into a template. My goal in the classroom is to make the underlying reasoning visible: how we define a policy question, what trade-offs we are making, what assumptions we are imposing, and how those assumptions shape our conclusions.

Students come to quantitative courses with very different levels of preparation and confidence. I try to provide structure early on—a clear way of approaching problems, common conceptual pitfalls, and explicit expectations—so that students can focus on thinking rather than guessing what to do next. Over time, I ask them to take more ownership: to justify their modeling choices, explain results in plain language, and reconsider their conclusions when assumptions change. I aim to create a classroom where asking foundational questions is welcomed and where careful reasoning is valued more than arriving at the “right” answer quickly. My hope is that students leave not only able to complete a health economics analysis, but confident in their ability to approach unfamiliar policy problems with clarity and discipline.
