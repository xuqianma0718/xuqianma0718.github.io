Xuqian Ma (she/her) is a PhD candidate in Health Policy (Health Economics) at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research examines cognition as both a determinant and an outcome of health, with a particular focus on aging populations. She studies how early-life and environmental factors shape cognition across the life course, and how cognitive capacity and decision-making quality influence health behaviors and outcomes.

Methodologically, she employs econometric and quasi-experimental approaches to generate causal evidence from large-scale surveys, experimental tasks, and environmental data. Current projects include analyzing the role of economic rationality in preventive health behaviors, the cognitive impacts of contemporaneous air pollution exposure in low-resource settings such as Kenya, and the long-term consequences of wartime bombing on mental and cognitive health in Vietnam.

She is a Graduate Student Researcher at the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), working with Professor Edward Miguel on research linking air pollution and cognition in Kenya. Her doctoral work has been supported by fellowships and awards from the UC Berkeley Health Policy Program and the Graduate Division.

Prior to her doctoral studies, she earned a Bachelor’s degree in Quantitative Economics and Econometrics from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and a Master’s degree in Applied Economics from Cornell University.
